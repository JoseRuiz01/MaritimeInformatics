# Maritime Informatics & Robotics Summer School ‚Äì 2025
üö§ Autonomous Surface Vessel Programming with Python, DroneKit, MQTT, and ArduPilot during the Maritime Informatics & Robotics Summer School.

## üìö Overview

This repository accompanies the **Maritime Informatics & Robotics Summer School 2025**, hosted by the **Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab (Smart MOVE)** at the **University of the Aegean, Syros**. It offers a hands-on, progressive curriculum for building, programming, and testing **autonomous maritime robots** using cutting-edge technologies in a real-world maritime environment.

## üî¨ Python Projects

The ``Code`` folder contains **7 progressive Python-based projects**, moving from basics to advanced multi-vessel systems:

| Project | Title | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 01 | Basic Telemetry | Connect to vehicle and read basic telemetry using DroneKit |
| 02 | MQTT Telemetry | Publish telemetry data remotely using MQTT |
| 03 | OOP Refactor | Introduce modular, maintainable object-oriented architecture |
| 04 | Multi-Vessel Roles | Develop a role-based system with WSL2 Docker integration |
| 05 | Pub/Sub Messaging | Implement MQTT JSON messaging for structured control |
| 06 | Remote Commanding | Send and process mission commands over the network |
| 07 | Vessel Coordination | Implement autonomous following and fleet behavior |

> All projects run on `ArduPilot Rover` with `FRAME_CLASS=2` for maritime surface platforms.

## üèÅ Aegean Roboat Race

Part of the summer school includes participation in the **Aegean Ro-boat Race** in the **IEEE Symposium on Maritime Informatics & Robotics** held at the ``Apollon Theatre`` in Ermoupolis, Syros island, Greece. This race consists in a competitive real-world challenge where teams:

- **Design and build autonomous boats (< 2.5m)**
- **Test navigation, collision avoidance, and autonomy**
- **Score points for innovation, sensor fusion, and autonomy**
- **Face real maritime conditions**

This event fosters collaboration between academia and industry, testing prototype technologies in the field.

## üåä Real-World Learning

- Use authentic sea trial data
- Apply critical thinking, hypothesis generation, and data analysis
- Participate in ‚Äúon-the-water‚Äù experimental evaluations
- Learn by doing: cookbook-style + open-ended experimentation
